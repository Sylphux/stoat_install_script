# Introduction

This is a simple shell install script for Stoat, an open source alternative for discord.

At the moment, Stoat is not supported by most package managers so this script will install it from the latest release on github.

# Usage

## Prerequisites

Be sure to have installed all the dependencies and chromium beforehand.

## Everything in one command

If you want the simplest experience possible, you can copy and paste this command that will do everything:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sylphux/stoat_install_script && cd stoat_install_script && chmod +x stoat_install.sh && ./stoat_install.sh
```

This will clone the repo and install Stoat.

## How to start the script

Clone the repo and use the following commands.

```shell
chmod +x stoat_install.sh
./stoat_install.sh
```

## Settings 

Some variables can be changed in the script to suit your needs.
